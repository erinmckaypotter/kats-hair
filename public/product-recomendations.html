          <h5>Smooth Shine Shampoo</h5>
          <p>
            This color-friendly shampoo is free of silicones and sulfates which fade your hair color. It works great to keep bright hair colors from fading quickly.

          <h4>Not Your Mother's</h4>
          <h5>  "Clean Freak" Dry Shampoo</h5>
          <p>
            Don't like to shampoo your hair everyday? This dry shampoo is my favorite for keeping greasy hair in check between shampoos. And as a bonus, less shampooing means bright hair colors longer!

          <h4>It's a 10</h4>
          <h5>Miracle Leave-In Conditioner Plus Keratin</h5>
          <p>
            I can't say enough good things about this leave-in conditioner. I have been using it for years after I wash my hair (and condition normally) to loosen tangles and keep my hair silky and frizz-free. It's a game-changer for dry, color-treated (or curly/course)hair that is hard to comb out after a wash.

          <h4>Nexxus Therappe</h4>
          <h5>Ultimate Moisture Moisturizing Shampoo</h5>
          <p>
            This shampoo and conditioner is a salon classic. I've been using this brand since I started doing hair professionally 35 years ago. The conditioner is particularly good for very dry, or course and curly hair, since it is super conditioning, and leaves your locks easy to untangle. The only downfall of this product is it is prone to built up on your hair. But use a rinse of 1 part apple cider vinegar to 2 parts water once a month, and it will take off the build up. They also make a silicone free version of this product which is not as prone to build up on your hair.

          <h4>OGX</h4>
          <h5>Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo & Conditioner</h5>
          <p>
            This is a favorite of a lot of my younger clients, since it is super affordable, sulfate & paraben free, and leaves your hair super silky. The Coconut Milk version works great for dry, damaged hair (particularly thick & course hair), but not everyone's hair loves coconut oil. If you're not a fan of coconut on your hair, I recommend trying some of their other shampoos to find one that works with your hair texture. For example, the Argan Oil version works great on more fine and frizzy hair.

          <h4>Wen</h4>
          <h5>Cleansing Conditioner</h5>
          <p>
            This product is a little unusual. It doesn't lather, and it is sort of a shampoo/conditioner combo, although not the kind you're used to. It's meant to be super conditioning and not strip your hair of natural oils. You massage it into your hair just like shampoo (be prepared for the zero-lather, it's weird), and then leave itin your hair for 5-10 min, and rinse. Your hair will be smoother than you ever felt it. However, if you have fine or thin hair, you might find this to be too much/ too greasy after a few washes. Curly haired people should definitely check this out though!
